Giles: Elsewhere in the conference I bumped into Shawn Henry of the Worldwide 
Web Consortium, the guiding body of the Web. I called her after the conference 
to ask about the new guidelines from the Web Accessibility Initiative, or WAI, 
known as WCAG 2.0. I began by asking her why we needed an update
when most people haven’t yet got to grips with the current guidelines.
