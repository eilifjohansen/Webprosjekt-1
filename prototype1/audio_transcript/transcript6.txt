Shawn: It is different from WCAG 1.0. We have already some additional materials 
that will help in understanding and applying WCAG 2.0 and we plan to have even more. 
For example right now we have the Quick Reference for WCAG 2.0. That lists the 
guidelines and success criteria along with the techniquesthat are sufficient
to meet those success criteria. So if you look at the guidelines with that view, 
then seeing the techniques along with the success criteria helps the developer 
understand the intent of the success criteria and how to develop to meet those success
criteria. We also have a document called Understanding WCAG 2.0. 
This is something that we didn’t have with WCAG 1.0. It provides answers 
to a lot of the questions that people have with WCAG 1.0. It includes 
sections like: what is the intent of this guideline and success criteria. 
It will help people know what the Working Group meant,
and what’s the reason for this guideline or success criteria. And it 
has sections on what are the common failures so you can see, “Oh, this
is how people usually mess up here”, and a section on how this helps 
people with disabilities. 
So already we have a lot of supporting information that will really help
people use, understand, interpret, and implement WCAG 2.0. And we have planned 
additional documentation especially aimed at people who are more new
to accessibility and doingmore basic Web development. We’ll continue to 
provide materials both for advance cutting edge things like AJAX accessibility 
as well as more materials for people who are more basic and more new to it.
