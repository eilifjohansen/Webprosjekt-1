Shawn: WCAG 2.0 will be much more appropriate for current and future Web development.
WCAG 1.0 was finalized in May of 1999 and it focused on HTML. Obviously a lot has 
changed since then. WCAG 2.0 is focused on applying more broadly to different 
technologies and is updated for the state of Web technology currently,as well as designed 
so that it can apply more relevantly as technology develops in the future.
